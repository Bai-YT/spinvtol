the protocol used is explained as follows

Host (PC) -> Copter
Each package is exactly 11 Bytes long, each have predesignated purposes

0,1: should both be 0x09, together they serve as alignment to indicate the start of a message
2: message type, valid numbers are:
  1: control update
  2: ping request
  3: Unrecoverable error
The remaining 8 bytes are padding except if message type = 1, in chich case:
3-4: Flap PWM deviation from neutral at max deflection, encoded with H, uint16_t, range (0,185)
5-6: Throttle PWM, encoded with H, uint16_t
5-10: control phase, the angle at which to apply max downward deflection, in rad, encoded with f, float

Copter -> Host(PC)
valid msg_type:
#define MSG_UPDATE 1
// ping response, remaining data in packet undefined
#define MSG_PING 2

// 8 bytes
struct monomsg{
    uint8_t msg_type;
    // 1: telemetry control, 2: RC control
    uint8_t telem_ctrl;
    // voltage(volts) * 100
    uint16_t voltage;
    uint16_t flapPWM;
    uint16_t throttlePWM;
};
